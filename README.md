# Auto Insurance Machine Learning Project
This project analyses an insurance claims dataset using machine learning models to predict whether fraud occurred. The dataset was analysed, processed and encoded to make it ready for modelling. Different classification models (logistic regression, KNN, SVC, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting) were then trained with the goal of predicting the most fraud possible, with adjustments to thresholds where applicable. The models were then compared against each other using different metrics such as accuracy, precision, ROC AUC, and feature importance.
